    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Last updated on <time datetime="2024-04-29">29th of April in 2024 (IST)</time>.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You. We use Your Personal data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>We do not collect personal data such as passwords, pins, or real-life credentials. The bot stores guild-specific settings organized by guild ID. Therefore, only your guild ID and the configuration is stored. Our bot does not request any personal data and strictly adheres to Discord's <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service (TOS)</a>.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>Purpose of Data</h3>
        <p>The sole purpose of this data is to enhance the music system experience. We do not collect any personal information about users. The data is utilized solely for improving the user interface and functionality of the bot.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>Data Retention</h3>
        <p>Your guild ID is retained for as long as the bot remains a member of your guild. Additionally, user and song information is stored for each music listening session. A session concludes either with the use of a stop command or when the queue is empty. Queue data is retained for a brief period when restarting the bot.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>Data Usage</h3>
        <p>The collected data is utilized exclusively within user-accessible commands. We do not employ this data for any other purposes beyond enhancing the bot's functionality and user experience.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not share user data with individuals or unregistered organizations. Our data is stored and shared with MongoDB Inc., a reputable database company. As we do not currently have the capability to host this data independently, partnering with MongoDB Inc. is essential. Access to this data is restricted to our team as outlined in our agreement with MongoDB Inc.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>

We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <h3>Policy Agreement</h3>
        <p>By utilizing our service (Deejay the Discord bot), you implicitly agree to the terms outlined in the above policy. Non-agreement necessitates refraining from using our provided services.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
